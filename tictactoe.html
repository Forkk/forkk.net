title: Tic-Tac-Toe
---

<p>This is a tic-tac-toe game written in JavaScript and HTML 5 with an AI that's pretty much unbeatable. You can also turn off the AI and play with a friend if you like.</p>

<p>I wrote this in 2012 and the AI is pretty much a brute force solution.
I could rewrite it and make it a lot nicer (the code certainly needs it), but I'd rather
keep it in its current state for nostalgia's sake.</p>

<p>If you manage to beat the AI, let me know
<a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}">on Twitter</a>.
Be sure to tell me how you beat it, so I can make it better ;)</a>
