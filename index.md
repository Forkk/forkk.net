# Hello World!

I'm Andrew (or Forkk). I'm a software developer.

I mostly work on open source software in various languages. Some of my favorites
are Rust, Kotlin, Haskell, and Python.

I also enjoy playing with different new technologies like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io), and [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)/[NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

# Projects

## MultiMC

MultiMC is a free, open source launcher for Minecraft. It allows you to have multiple, cleanly separated installations of Minecraft (each with their own mods, texture packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them and their associated options with a simple and powerful interface.

I started the MultiMC project and developed it and maintained the infrastructure and automated
build systems for about 4 years. It's now in the very capable hands of
[peterix](https://github.com/peterix).

Check it out at [multimc.org](https://multimc.org).

## MCArchive

MCArchive is a project aimed at archiving all Minecraft mods forever.
The project consists of a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MCArchive/metarepo)
containing YAML files with metadata about each mod, and a [website](https://mcarchive.net)
listing those mods. Mod files are stored in [IPFS](https://www.ipfs.io), allowing anyone to
mirror the entire archive trivially.

Check it out at [mcarchive.net](https://mcarchive.net).

## ...and more

I also have several other projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Forkk). Many of them are unfinished, but functional.
